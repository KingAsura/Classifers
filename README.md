# Classifers
KNN,Linear Regression and Centroid classifers.

This is a matlab code that performs the following four classifiers on a set of data .
The data is also included in the program folder.

1.KNN classifier

2.Centroid Classifier

3.Linear Regression classifer

3 classifiers to run on AT&T50 file to learn  the model paramters and predict the class labels for test images

3 classifiers to run on AT&T200 file to learn  the model paramters and predict the class labels for test images

to get the answers for these classifications you just have to change the file name in main program.

the data in these files are in the format  where each column represents one vector and rows represent the feature of the vector. 
and the first row of the data contains the class of the vectors.
